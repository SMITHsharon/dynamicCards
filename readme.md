### Project Specs
1. Created an HTML page containing a text area and a button labeled `Create`.
2. When the user enters text into the text area and then clicks the `Create` button: Create a new card element in the DOM. The height/width of the card are discretionary element designs.
3. When the user clicks the `Delete` button: The containing card, and no other cards, are removed from the DOM. i.e., Not just made invisible, actually removed from the DOM.
