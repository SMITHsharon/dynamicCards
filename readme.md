### Project Specs
1. Creates an `html` page containing a text area and a button labeled `Create`.
2. When the user enters text into the text area and then clicks the `Create` button: 
  - Creates a new Card element in the DOM. The height/width of the Card are discretionary design elements.
3. When the user clicks the `Delete` button: 
  - The containing Card, and no other Cards, are removed from the DOM. 
  - i.e., Not just made invisible, actually removed from the DOM.
